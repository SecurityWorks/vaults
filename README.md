It currently uses [gocryptfs](https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs) and [CryFS](https://github.com/cryfs/cryfs/) for encryption.

Please always keep a backup of your encrypted files.

Note: This is an early release. It should work fine, however, UI might be inconsistent and is about to be polished in following releases.

## How to build
